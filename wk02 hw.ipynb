    "\n",
    "You are a contestant on a game show.\n",
    "There are three doors. Behind one door is a car (your desired prize), and behind the other two doors are goats (undesirable prizes).\n",
    "You choose one door, but the host (Monty Hall), who knows what’s behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.\n",
    "Monty then gives you a choice: stick with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door.\n",
    "The puzzle asks whether you should switch or stick with your initial choice.\n",
    "The solution shows that switching gives you a 2/3 chance of winning, while sticking gives you only a 1/3 chance. Let's simulate this scenario with Python.\n"
